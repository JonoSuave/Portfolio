# Background Design Specification

---

## 1. Base Canvas

- **Color**: Start with a clean, white (`#FFFFFF`) background as the primary canvas.

---

## 2. Subtle Pastel Blurs

- **Placement**: Introduce soft, blurred circles or patches of pastel color in a few strategic spots, typically around the corners or edges.
- **Colors**:
  - Light pink (`#FADADD` or similar)
  - Pale green (`#DAF5D9` or similar)
  - Very light purple (`#EAE6F7` or similar)
- **Blending**: Use a Gaussian Blur or feathered edges so that the color transitions are smooth and unobtrusive.

**Instruction Example (pseudo-code)**:

    1.	Add shape (circle or oval) with color #FADADD.
    2.	Apply a large Gaussian Blur (e.g., 50px–150px radius).
    3.	Set the shape’s opacity to around 20–30%.
    4.	Position it near a corner (top-left or top-right).
    5.	Repeat with pastel green and light purple in different corners.

## 3. Minimal Geometric Line Accents

- **Type of Lines**: Thin, curved lines or circular arcs.
- **Color & Opacity**: Light gray (`#E0E0E0`) or near-black (`#555555`) at very low opacity (10–20%) so they remain subtle.
- **Placement**: Often placed in corners or edges, partially off-canvas, to frame the layout.
- **Thickness**: Keep the stroke width thin (1–2px).

**Instruction Example**: 1. Draw a circular arc or partial curve in the top-right corner. 2. Use stroke color #555555 at 15% opacity, stroke width 1px. 3. Repeat a similar shape in the bottom-left corner.

---

## 4. Overall Style & Balance

- The background should feel **minimal and airy**, allowing the main content (e.g., a central image or text) to stand out.
- Keep the pastel shapes and lines **subtle**—they’re primarily decorative accents, not the main focus.
- Make sure there is **enough white space** in the center for content.

## Summary

    1.	Create a white (#FFFFFF) background as the base.
    2.	Add 2–3 softly blurred pastel shapes (light pink, pale green, light purple) at low opacity, positioned near corners.
    3.	Introduce thin, low-opacity geometric arcs/lines in a couple of corners.
    4.	Adjust overall opacity, blur, and placement to maintain a clean, minimal look.
